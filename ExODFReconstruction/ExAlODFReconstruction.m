%% ODF Reconstruction from X-Ray Diffraction Data of an Al Alloy Rolled Sheet
%
%
%% Import the Data
%
% The following pole figure intensities have been measured by a Philips
% X'Pert diffractometer using Cu-Kalpha radiation. The sample comes from
% a commercial aluminum alloy (AA6061-T4) sheet of 0.9 mm thickness.
% Scans were done over the RD-TD plane of the sheet (RD//X; TD//Y; ND//Z).
% The tree main FCC poles for XRD were scanned, i.e., {1 1 1}, {2 0 0}, {2 2 0}.

% Lets import the raw data

% crystal symmetry
CS = crystalSymmetry('m-3m', [1 1 1],'mineral','Al');

% create a Pole Figure variable containing the data
fname = fullfile(mtexExamplePath,'ExODFReconstruction','data','alt4_*.rw1');
pf = PoleFigure.load(fname,CS,'interface','rw1');

plot(pf, 'colorrange', 'tight', 'minmax')

%% Background and Defocusing Correction
%
% When working with X-ray diffraction the intensities are usually corrupted
% by background radiation as well as a decay of the intensities towards the
% equator. This effect can somehow be estimated by measuring an untextured
% powder sample. In the present case the following powder intensities were
% determined.

h = Miller({1 1 1}, {2 0 0}, {2 2 0},CS);

% This texture shows the typically dominant 'cube' orientation due to
% recrystallization after rolling of Al alloy plates and sheets.
% There's a slight misalignment of the sample's orthotropy axes wrt the
% X-Y directions. This is due to a small deviation of the sample when
% positioned on the goniometer of the X-ray diffractometer.
